\subsection{What Constitutes Reception?}
\begin{frame}[t]{What Constitutes Reception?}
\small
\begin{block}{}
\textsl{Reception} happens when one planet (A) is in the domicile or exaltation of another planet (B) whom it aspects or conjuncts. The aspect (or conjunction) from planet \textsl{A} must \textsl{perfect} (become exact)  before that of a third planet (C) intercedes by completing its own aspect or conjunction with planet \textsl{B}, or, before \textsl{B} moves into another sign.

\Mars\ is applying to \Conjunction\ \Saturn\ who is in \Mars's domicile (\Aries), therefore\\
\Mars\ \textsl{receives} \Saturn, but, \\
\Mars\ is not in a domicile (\Capricorn, \Aquarius) or Exaltation (\Libra) of \Saturn, so \\
\Saturn\ \textsl{does not receive} \Mars\ (this is a weaker reception than if \Saturn\ received \Mars) \\

\Mars\ is in \Saturn's domicile (\Capricorn) applying to \Square\ \Saturn \\
\Saturn\ is in \Mars's domicile (\Aries), therefore, \\
\Mars\ receives \Saturn\ and \Saturn\ receives \Mars\ and \\
there is \textbf{Mutual Reception} [MR] by \textsl{domicile} (strongest form of reception)
\end{columns}
\vspace{0.2cm}
 MR can happen by Exaltation if the two planets are in each other's signs of exaltation. Masha'Allah tells us that if the matter being analyzed has to do with a King, the Exaltation rulers will have more authority over the matter than the domicile rulers.

\begin{frame}[t]{What Constitutes Reception Continued}
Mutual reception by domicile is the strongest form of reception followed by Mutual reception by exaltation.

As a general rule, reception is stronger if the planet applied to (B) receives the applying planet (A).

Later authors also considered reception by triplicity, term, and face but only considered it to an \textsl{effective} reception if the reception involved at least two of these minor dignities i.e. received by triplicity and term or triplicity and face or term and face. Masha'Allah mentions these minor dignities in his \textsl{Book of Thoughts and Intentions} but only in relation to determining which planet is stronger than another.
