\Venus\ (L1) partile \Sextile\ 2nd but no aspect to 1st \\
\Moon\ \Trine\ 1st $\Rightarrow$ \Square\ \Mars\ (L2) without reception \\

\vspace{0.2cm}
\Venus\ ruling the 1st and 8th, peregrine and cadent, would indicate his concern over debts (8th) as does \Mars\ (expenses) in the 2nd.  \Venus\ is  \Opposition\ \Saturn, ruler of the 5th (gambling) which contains the \Moon\ so both of the querent's significators point to him being involved with gambling. \\

\vspace{0.2cm}
An aspect between the two significators means the finances will improve as even though there is no reception, \Mars\ is dignified.

\vspace{0.2cm}
The querent received additional money approximately 9 weeks after he posed the question; weeks rather than days as both significators are in fixed signs and succedent houses and the \Moon\ had to move 9Â° to complete the \Square.\\

\vspace{0.25cm}
Looking to L2 to see how he fares after he gets the money, we find \Mars\ VOC and moving into combustion (\Conjunction\ \Sun); in the spring, he lost all his money gambling.
