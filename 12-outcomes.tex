\textbf{Axiom:} In all matters \textsl{"when the disposition comes to a planet which receives the lord of the matter sought for, that matter will be made fortunate, and it will be perfected."}
\end{block}

If the significator of the querent joins and is received by the significator of the matter then the matter will be perfected and complete when the joining is complete.

The number of degrees to the completed joining give an indication as to timing; depending on the context, they can represent years, months, weeks, days, or hours.

If the significators started off Void of Course, needing to enter a new sign before joining with  another planet, then things will go slowly and mattes will be prolonged.
