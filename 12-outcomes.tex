\textbf{Axiom:} In all matters \textsl{"when the disposition comes to a planet which receives the lord of the matter sought for, that matter will be made fortunate, and it will be perfected."}
\end{block}

If the significator of the querent joins and is received by the significator of the matter then the matter will be perfected and complete when the joining is complete. The number of degrees to the completed joining give an indication as to timing; depending on the context, they can represent years, months, weeks, days, or hours. If the significators started off Void of Course, needing to enter a new sign before joining with  another planet, then things will go slowly and matters will be prolonged.

\textbf{Axiom:} \textsl{"After that, the ruler of the house of the thing [quesited] is looked at to see to what planet it commits its own disposition after its effecting...if it is a benefic, they say the thing will be made better. And if it is a malefic, they say that the thing will be subsequently destroyed."} [JH]p22

The exception is if the question is about death.
