\textsl{Perfection, i.e. the performance of a thing is perhaps known from the planet to which the ruler of the Asc is first joined; from the \Moon; or from the second one that receives the commitment [of the disposition], or namely from whichever one is the last reception [and] there will be the end; or from the ruler of the thing quesited; or from a benefic that is in a good place without reception.} [JH p36]
\end{block}
And \textsl{perfection} can come about in a number of ways ([RH p31])
\begin{itemize}
\item significator of the querent to the significator of the quesited with or without reception
\item a planet in the 1st receiving L1 or the \Moon\
\item a benefic, angular planet, or strongly dignified planet receiving L1 or the \Moon\
\item L1 joining a benefic in the house signifying the matter
\item L1 joining any planet with dignity in the house signifying the matter
\item L1 joining, and received by, a malefic in the house signifying the matter
\end{itemize}

\textsl{"Reception will not be destroyed in any way whatsoever,...,if the planet which receives has rulership over a matter, and it is the dispositor [of the querent's significator] and the disposition comes to it [the querent's significator applies to it], and if it does not commit dispositoin to another. Because if it should commit disposition to another planet after its own reception, the reception signifies the accomplishment of the matter, and the commission of its disposition to another planet signifies the end of the matter and to what [state] its final affairs would come."} [RH p32]
\end{block}

\textsl{"After that, the ruler of the house of the thing [quesited] is looked at to see to what planet it commits its own disposition after its effecting...if it is a benefic, they say the thing will be made better. And if it is a malefic, they say that the thing will be subsequently destroyed."} [JH]p22
\end{block}

The exception is if the question is about death as there is nothing that can come after it.
