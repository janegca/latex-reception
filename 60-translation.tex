\Mercury\ (L1) (querent) \Quincunx\ \Jupiter\ (L7) (marriage) \\
\Moon\ separating \Sextile\ \Mercury\ applying \Square\ \Jupiter \\

Therefore, the \Moon\ was carrying the light of \Mercury\ to \Jupiter\ \textsl{"and this signified the completion of the thing, i.e. the attainment of the woman through the hands of go-betweens and those running back and forth between the two [parties]."} ([JH] p14-15) \\

\textbf{Note:} \\
\small
In this example, it would seem that the \Moon\ is  the querent's main significator as \Mercury\ does not aspect the 1st house. \\
