\subsection{What Constitutes Reception?}
\begin{frame}[t]{What Constitutes Reception?}
\small
\begin{block}{}
\textsl{Reception} happens when one planet (A) is in the domicile or exaltation of another planet (B) whom it aspects or conjuncts. The aspect (or conjunction) from planet \textsl{A} must \textsl{perfect} (become exact)  before planet \textsl{B} moves into another sign or a third planet (C) intercedes by completing its own aspect or conjunction with planet \textsl{B}.
\end{block}

While Masha'Allah appears to have been the first to begin categorizing and explaining the way reception, applications, and separations indicate outcomes Sahl ibn Bishr al-Israili (786-845) appears to have been the first to spell out the 16 distinct modes of the "perfection and destruction of things". These were also listed and amplified by  Abu Ma'shar (787-886),  Ibn Ezra (1089-1164).

Examples from these authors are used to name and describe the various ways in which reception can occur. The referenced texts are:

\subsubsection{Perfect Reception}
\begin{frame}[t]{What Constitutes Reception - Perfect Reception}
\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{columns}[T, onlytextwidth]
\column{0.5\textwidth}
An example of \textbf{perfect reception} (according to Sahl\footnotemark[1]) is a planet applying to the domicile or exaltation ruler of the sign it occupies. Abu Ma'shar calls it \textsl{"pushing nature"}, Ibn Ezra, \textsl{"conferring of nature"}\footnotemark[2] \\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Example (A $\Rightarrow$ B): \Moon\ in \Aries\ $\Rightarrow$ \Mars\ or \Sun} 
\ul
\vspace{0.2cm}
\Moon\ in \Aries\ applying to either of \\
\Mars\ (domicile ruler) or \\
\Sun\ (exaltation ruler) \\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\Mars\ or the \Sun\ can be in any sign; they receive the \Moon\ because she is in \Aries\ which \Mars\ rules by domicile and the \Sun\ by exaltation.\\

\footnotetext[2]{Abu Ma'shar p.24 as the sign A occupies has the same nature as the planet B, A pushes B's own nature onto B. Ibn Ezra p.121 says the ruler B confers its nature upon A.}

\subsubsection{A Weaker Reception}
\begin{frame}[t]{What Constitutes Reception - A Weaker Reception}
\begin{columns}[T, onlytextwidth]
\column{0.5\textwidth}
A planet in its own domicile or exaltation applying to another planet is said by Abu Ma'shar to \textsl{"push [its] power"} to the other planet.\footnotemark[1] Ibn Ezra calls it \textsl{"conferring influence"}, Sahl, \textsl{"giving virtue" or "commiting disposition"}.\footnotemark[2]This too is a form of reception but it is considered weaker than perfect reception.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\textbf{Example (A $\Rightarrow$ B):} \Mars\ or \Sun\ in \Aries\ $\Rightarrow$  \Saturn \\
\ul
\vspace{0.2cm}
\Mars\ or \Sun\ in \Aries\ applying to  \\
\Saturn\ in any sign \\
\vspace{0.25cm}
Note that strictly speaking Sahl would consider this a 'non-reception' as \Aries\ is \Saturn's Fall.\footnotemark[3] Other authors accept it as a corrupted reception.

\subsubsection{Pushing Two Natures}
\begin{frame}[t]{What Constitutes Reception - Pushing Two Natures}
\begin{columns}[T, onlytextwidth]
\column{0.5\textwidth}
Occurs when a planet (A) in its domicile or exaltation applies to another planet (B) who also has dignity in \textsl{A's} place\footnotemark[1] \\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\textbf{Example (A $\Rightarrow$ B):} \Venus\ in \Pisces\ $\Rightarrow$ \Jupiter \\
\ul
\Venus\ exalted in \Pisces\ applies to \\
\Jupiter\ who is the domicile ruler of \Pisces \\
\vspace{0.25cm}

Rob Hand also describes another form of reception called \textbf{communion} which happens when two planets are found in the same sign with one ruling the sign and the other being the exaltation ruler of the sign e.g. \Moon\ and \Jupiter\ both in \Cancer, or \Mars\ and \Sun\ both in \Aries, etc.

\subsubsection{Mutual Reception}
\begin{frame}[t]{What Constitutes Reception - Mutual Reception}
\begin{columns}[T, onlytextwidth]
\column{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{Example:} \Mars\ 10 \Capricorn\ $\Rightarrow$ \Square\ \Saturn\ 20 \Aries \\
\ul
\vspace{0.25cm}
\Mars\ is in \Saturn's domicile (\Capricorn) applying to \Saturn \\
\Saturn\ is in \Mars's domicile (\Aries), therefore, \\
\Mars\ receives \Saturn\ by domicile, and \\
\Saturn\ receives \Mars\ by domicile \\
\vspace{0.25cm}
giving  \textbf{Mutual Reception} [MR] by \textsl{domicile} \\
so \Mars\ receives \Saturn\ and commits his disposition to him and \Saturn\ receives it\footnotemark[1]\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
This is the strongest form of reception; the second strongest form occurs when there is mutual reception by \textsl{exaltation}. e.g. both planets are in each other's sign of exaltation. i.e. \Venus\ in \Cancer\ \Trine\ \Jupiter\ in \Pisces.

\subsubsection{Corrupted Receptions and Returns}
\begin{frame}[t]{What Constitutes Reception - Corrupted Receptions}
There can be \textbf{no reception} if neither planet has dignity in their own or the other planet's place e.g. \Mercury\ $\Rightarrow$ \Jupiter\ in \Taurus\ where both are peregrine. Although Masha'allah does describe a situation which allows for eventual reception if the applied to planet goes on to apply, with reception, to a third planet.\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
While Sahl denies reception if a planet is in his own Fall or applying to another planet from that planet's Fall, the other authors appear to accept the reception but say that it is corrupted or greatly diminished i.e. the outcome to the matter is far less than what was hoped for or fails to last.\\
\vspace{0.25cm}
As well, a receiving planet that is \textbf{retrograde} or \textbf{USB} will return what it received, destroying it in the process. The same occurs if both planets are cadent.\footnotemark[1] \\
\vspace{0.25cm}
Still another form of return occurs when a planet applies to a cadent planet, in which case Sahl says the matter \textsl{"will not have an ending"}.

\begin{frame}[t]{What Constitutes Reception Continued}

Masha'allah tells us that if the matter being analyzed has to do with a King, the Exaltation rulers will have more authority over the matter than the domicile rulers.

As a general rule, reception is stronger if the planet applied to (usually the heavier planet) receives the applying planet (usually the lighter planet).

The later authors (Sahl, Abu Ma'shar, Ibn Ezra) also allowed reception by triplicity, term, and face but only considered it to be an \textsl{effective} reception if it involved at least two of these minor dignities i.e. received by triplicity and term or triplicity and face or term and face. Masha'allah does mention these minor dignities in his \textsl{Book of Thoughts and Intentions} but only in relation to determining which planet has the most authority over a specific matter; he does not use them in any of his \textsl{On Reception} examples.
\begin{block}{}
Reception is important as it implies completion; that the matter will be disposed of or handled, brought to a conclusion, by the receiving planet; that what the significator commits to another will be effected, manifested, brought into being. No reception and what is signified will not be.
