\begin{frame}[t]{Which Chart Elements are Examined?}

The following elements of a chart are examined in judging what will or will not be:
\begin{itemize}
\item the 5 planets and two luminaries
\item the 12 zodiac signs
\item the signs of  the Exaltations and Falls of the planets
\item the applications and separations of the planets by \Conjunction, \Sextile, \Square, \Trine, or \Opposition\ 
\item receptions between the planets as they relate to the disposition of matters they signify
\item whether a planet's dispositions are effected, prohibited, rejected, or returned
\end{itemize}

The state of a significator's \textsl{disposition} helps establish how a matter is effected and its eventual outcome.
