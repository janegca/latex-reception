The following elements of a chart are examined in judging what will or will not be:
\begin{itemize}
\item the 5 planets and two luminaries
\item the 12 zodiac signs
\item the signs of  the Exaltations and Falls of the planets
\item the applications and separations of the planets by \Conjunction, \Sextile, \Square, \Trine, or \Opposition\ 
\item receptions between the planets
\item the giving (pushing) of a planet's dispositions
\item the prohibition or rejection of a disposition
\end{itemize}

The state of the significator's \textsl{disposition} either \textsl{perfects} (brings about) or \textsl{prohibits} whatever matters the significator represents.
