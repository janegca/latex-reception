\begin{frame}[t]{Which Chart Elements are Examined?}

The following elements of a chart are examined in judging what will or will not be:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$] the 5 planets and two luminaries
\item[$\bullet$] the 12 zodiac signs and their domicile rulers
\item[$\bullet$] the signs of  the Exaltations and Falls of the planets
\item[$\bullet$] the applications and separations of the planets by \Conjunction, \Sextile, \Square, \Trine, or \Opposition\ 
\item[$\bullet$] mutual receptions, return of reception, and "the mutual giving of their disposition"
\end{itemize}

The manner in which a planet commits its \textsl{disposition} helps establish if its significations are effected, prohibited, corrupted, rejected or returned.
