\subsection{Chart Elements Examined}
\begin{frame}[t]{Chart Elements}

The following elements of a chart are examined in judging what will or will not be:
\begin{itemize}
\item the 7 planets
\item the 12 zodiac signs
\item the places of  the Exaltations and Falls of the planets
\item the applications and separations of the standard Ptolemaic aspects (\Sextile, \Square, \Trine, \Opposition) and the \Conjunction
\item Mutual receptions
\item return of reception
\item planets giving (pushing) their dispositions
\end{itemize}

\textsl{"It will be according to what disposition the significator comes to"}[RH p1] or \textsl{"And the significator will be the one to which the disposition comes"}[JH p11] and the 'disposition' either effects or prohibits the matter. {\color{red} Not clear what is meant, is the significator the final planet in a chain of dispositions?}
