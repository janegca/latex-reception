\subsection{The Joining of Planets}
\begin{frame}[t]{The Joining of Planets}
\begin{block}{}
 Planets are \textsl{joined together} (connected) by recognized aspects (\Sextile, \Square, \Trine, \Opposition) or bodily \Conjunction's that are within orb and will eventually become \textsl{exact by degree}.
 \end{block}
\textbf{Benefics joined to Benefics}\footnotemark[1]

A benefic (\Venus\ or \Jupiter) joined to another benefic is good; if there is also reception, the good indicated by the planets is increased.

\textbf{Benefics joined to Malefics}

If a benefic (\Venus\ or \Jupiter) joins with and is received by a malefic planet (\Mars\ or \Saturn) then the malefics are at peace and \textsl{"their evil goes away"} unless they are joined by a \Square\ or \Opposition, in which case there will be some labour, and error.

\textbf{Malefics joined to Malefics}

If a malefic (\Mars\ or \Saturn) joins with another malefic with reception, they are made good and their evil and impediment goes away. Ibn Ezra says they can receive each other by \Conjunction, \Sextile, or \Trine\  \textsl{``but not in the other aspects''} (p.124)
