\hspace{1em}dispositor, \Venus, is combust, worsening matters \\

\begin{frame}[t]{Dukedom Chart as Battle Chart}
Masha'Allah goes further into the chart, reading it as a 'battle' or 'war' chart; he begins with the \Moon, using it's separating to identify the querent and its application to identify the rebel lord. \\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\Jupiter\ in \Virgo\ \Trine\ (not rec'd) $\Leftarrow$ \Moon\ in \Capricorn\ $\Rightarrow$ \Opposition\ \Mars\ in \Cancer\ (mixed reception) \\
\hspace{1em}\Moon\ is significator of the opponent  in the 2nd (support for querent) \\
\hspace{1em}\Mars\ retro, in 8th, in his Fall; indicating the opponents penury (8th is 2nd from 7th) \\
\hspace{1em} Masha'Allah says this indicates the rebel lord could not pay his army \\
\hspace{1em} so the querent bought them off; ending the battle \\
\vspace{0.25cm}
But, as \Mars\ is the dispositor of \Mercury\ (L7), and it is in a strong reception with the \Moon, the rebel lord will not lose everything and, as already noted, \Mercury's \Sextile\ to \Jupiter\ indicates a peaceful conclusion for all involved.
