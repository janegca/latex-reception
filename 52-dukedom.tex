\Jupiter\ is L1, direct, in the 10th (most elevated planet) \\
\hspace{1em}\Sun\ \& \Venus\ $\Rightarrow$ \Square\ from \Sagittarius\ in 1st (received) \\
\hspace{1em}he aspects both his domiciles \Sagittarius\ and \Pisces\ \\

\hspace{1em}signifying he will get his dukedom\\

\Mercury\ is L7, retro, a rebel opponent in the matter \\
\hspace{1em}cadent in the 12th \\
\hspace{1em}$\Rightarrow$ \Opposition\ \Saturn\ without reception, and \\
\vspace{0.2cm}
\Saturn\ is retro, cadent, with his dispositor, \Venus, combust; worsening matters, and indicating destruction for the opponent \\

Masha'allah goes further into the chart, reading it as a 'battle' or 'war' chart; he begins with the \Moon, using its separating to identify the querent and its application to identify the rebel lord. \\
\vspace{0.25cm}
\Moon\ separating \Trine\ \Jupiter\ (not rec'd) \\
\Moon\ applying \Opposition\ \Mars\ in \Cancer\ (mixed reception) \\
\vspace{0.2cm}
The \Moon\ is the significator of the opponent  in the 2nd (support for querent) \\
\Mars\ retro, in 8th, in his Fall; indicates the opponents penury (8th is 2nd from 7th) \\
\vspace{0.2cm}
Masha'allah says this indicates the rebel lord could not pay his army
so the querent bought them off; ending the battle \\
\vspace{0.25cm}
But, as \Mars\ is the dispositor of \Mercury\ (L7), and it is in a strong reception with the \Moon, the rebel lord will not lose everything and, as already noted, \Mercury\ to the \Sextile\ to \Jupiter\ indicates a peaceful conclusion for all involved.\\
\vspace{0.2cm}
This is the last of Masha'allah's examples.
