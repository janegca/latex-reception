\subsection{The Joining of Planets}
\begin{frame}[t]{Reception and the Joining of Planets}
\begin{block}{}
 Planets are \textsl{joined together} by recognized aspects (\Sextile, \Square, \Trine, \Opposition) or bodily \Conjunction's that become \textsl{exact by degree} and happen when at least one of the planets involved is in the other's domicile or exaltation.
 \end{block}
\textbf{Benefics joined to Benefics}\footnotemark[1]

If a benefic (\Venus\ or \Jupiter) joins with and is received by another benefic, the reception increases the good indicated by the planets.

\textbf{Benefics joined to Malefics}

If a benefic (\Venus\ or \Jupiter) joins with and is received by a malefic planet (\Mars\ or \Saturn) then the malefics are at peace and \textsl{"their evil goes away"} unless they are joined by a \Square\ or \Opposition, in which case there will be some labour, and error.

\textbf{Malefics joined to Malefics}

If a malefic (\Mars\ or \Saturn) joins with another malefic with reception, they are made good and their evil and impediment goes away.
