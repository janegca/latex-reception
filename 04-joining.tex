\subsection{Reception and the Joining of Planets}
\begin{frame}[t]{Reception and the Joining of Planets}
\textbf{Benefics joined to Benefics}

If a benefic (\Venus\ or \Jupiter) joins with and is received by another benefic, the reception increases the good indicated by the planets.

\textbf{Benefics joined to Malefics}

If a benefic (\Venus\ or \Jupiter) joins with and is received by a malefic planet (\Mars\ or \Saturn) then the malefics are at peace and \textsl{"their evil goes away"} unless they are joined by a \Square\ or \Opposition, in which case there will be some labour, and error.

\textbf{Malefics joined to Malefics}

If a malefic (\Mars\ or \Saturn) joins with another malefic with reception, they are made good and their evil and impediment goes away.

\textbf{Note:} the above are generalities based on the essential nature of the planets; there are conditions under which a benefic can act as a malefic and vice versa.
