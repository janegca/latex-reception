\textbf{They will escape death:}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item L1 to a benefic who is not L8 and who does not pass on disposition or return it to another 
\vspace{0.25cm}

\item L1 to a planet that receives him, and if they are ill, they will recover from their illness
\vspace{0.25cm}

\item \Moon\ joined to L8 but L1 strong and unimpeded
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Death wins out:}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item L1 joined to L8 or vice versa (do not consider the \Moon) 
\vspace{0.25cm}

\item L1 joined to a malefic or L8 without reception and the \Moon\ evil and impeded
\end{itemize}

To know if the person will fully recover their  'good fortune and health' examine the planet that signifies escape from death; if it aspects the significator's original position in the chart the person will escape all harm.\footnote{Robert Hand fnp11}
