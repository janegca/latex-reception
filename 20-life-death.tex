If a person asks whether he will die during the year, look for indications that:\footnote{If L1 is impeded, use the \Moon\ in its place.}
\vspace{0.25cm}
\begin{columns}[T, onlytextwidth]
\column{0.5\textwidth}
\textbf{They will escape death:}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item L1 to a benefic who is not L8 and who does not pass on disposition or return it to another 
\vspace{0.25cm}

\item L1 to a planet that receives him, and if they are ill, they will recover from their illness
\vspace{0.25cm}

\item \Moon\ joined to L8 but L1 strong and unimpeded
\item L8 joined to and received by L1 \textsl{"will not completely destroy"} life
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Death wins out:}\\
\begin{itemize}
\item L1 joined to L8 or vice versa (do not consider the \Moon) 
\item L1 joined to a malefic or L8 without reception and the \Moon\ evil and impeded
\item L1 joined to a malefic in the 8th
\item L1 joined, without reception, to a benefic in the 8th who has dignity there
\item L8 joined to a planet in the 1st
\end{itemize}

To know if the person will fully recover their  'good fortune and health' examine the planet that signifies escape from death; if it aspects the significator's original position in the chart the person will escape all harm.\footnote{Robert Hand fnp11}

\begin{itemize}
\item when L8 joins and is received by L1, L8 cannot completely destroy life but we need to look at L1 and the \Moon\ and if one signifies life and the other death, the significations of L1 are stronger as it has more significance in the matter of Life than the \Moon; however, as they are partners, the \Moon\ will impact the effects of L1 according to the strength or weakness of L1 and the \Moon

\item L8 is inimical to L1 UNLESS they are the same planet as \textsl{"then it will not impedite itself, even if it is also a malefic"} (and the same is true of L1 and L6)
\end{itemize}
