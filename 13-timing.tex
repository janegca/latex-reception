When the joining is by aspect (not conjunction) the number of degrees needed to perfect the aspect gives the number of days.

If it doesn't happen then, it will happen when the two join bodily in a strong place, an angle or a place where the significator of the matter rejoices.

If not then, it will happen when the planet handling the disposition is rising from the \Sun, renewing itself.

If the significators started off Void of Course, needing to enter a new sign before joining with  another planet, then things will go slowly and matters will be prolonged [JH 17, RH 8]

Angles strengthen, hurry, and fortify the matter and, for good or ill, whatever is signified by the ruler of the disposition, it will last. [JH p36]
