\subsection{Looking to Borrow}
\begin{frame}[t]{Looking to Borrow}
If a person is looking to borrow from another, L1 and the \Moon\ signify the querent, L2, his wealth while L7 and L8 signify the possible lender and their wealth.

The querent will get what he seeks if:
\begin{itemize}
\item L1 or the \Moon\ are joined to L8 or a planet in the 8th
\item L8 is joined to L1 or a planet in the 1st that is a benefic, a dignified malefic, or a malefic that receives it
\item either L1 or the \Moon\ joined to a malefic with reception or a benefic in a strong place
\end{itemize}

But if the person is looking to borrow from the King, use the 11th (Wealth of the King) instead of the 8th.
