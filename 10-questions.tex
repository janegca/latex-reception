\begin{frame}[t]{Questions in General}

A question must be of great concern or necessity for the querent (the one asking the question); and they should not ask further questions with regard to the matter until the first question has been understood and examined (i.e. no compound questions).

An astrologer should not look to answer his own questions as \textsl{"it does not suit a wise man to look for himself"}. 

To examine the question, draw up a chart for the time the question is asked or verbally put to the astrologer; or, if in the form of a letter, the moment when the astrologer understands what is asked; calculating the Asc, the MC, the places of the 7 planets, and note who disposits each of them and which houses they are in.

\textbf{Note:} James Holden thinks the calculation of the MC implies a quadrant system of houses, most likely Alchabitius, but he acknowledges that Masha'Allah, in later examples, appears to be using a Sign-House system; most likely Equal House\footnote{In Holden's translation of Masha'Allah's \textsl{The Book of Thoughts} he indicates that either the Alchabitius or Equal House system were used.}
