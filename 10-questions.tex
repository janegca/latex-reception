A question must be of great concern or necessity for the querent (the one asking the question); and they should not ask further questions with regard to the matter until the first question has been understood and examined i.e. don't begin the analysis with a series of questions; a clear, concise question is best

An astrologer should not look to answer his own questions as \textsl{"it does not suit a wise man to look for himself"}. 

To examine the question, draw up a chart for the time the question is verbally put to the astrologer; or, if in the form of a letter, the moment when the astrologer understands what is asked; calculate the Asc, the MC, the places of the 7 planets, and note who disposits each of them and which houses they are in.

\textbf{Note:} James Holden thinks the calculation of the MC implies a quadrant system of houses, most likely Alchabitius, but he acknowledges that Masha'Allah, in later examples, appears to be using a Sign-House system or Equal House system. House cusps given in the following example charts are from the printed book but were not original to Masha'Allah.\footnote{In Holden's translation of Masha'Allah's \textsl{The Book of Thoughts and Intentions} he indicates that either the Alchabitius or Equal House systems were used.}
