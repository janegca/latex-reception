\subsection{Committing Disposition}
\begin{frame}[t]{Committing Disposition}
\small
\begin{block}{}
Any planet (A) joining another (B) from B's domicile or exaltation \textsl{commits its disposition} to \textsl{B}, who, because of reception, will perfect the matter signified by \textsl{A}.
\end{block}

The language used here makes sense in that if \textsl{A} is in a domicile of \textsl{B} he is a guest in \textsl{B}'s home. Astrologically speaking, the ruler of the domicile (B) is responsible for \textsl{settling} or \textsl{disposing} of all matters within his domicile, including those of other planets lodged there.

The nature of the aspect qualifies the nature of the request as a hard one (\Square, \Opposition), an easy one (\Sextile, \Trine), or a familiar, or congenial, one (\Conjunction).

\textbf{Example:}
\begin{columns}[T, onlytextwidth]
\column{0.25\textwidth}
\Sun\ 10 \Aries\ \Square\ \Mars\ 10 \Capricorn

\column{0.01\textwidth}
\rule{.1mm}{.27\textheight}

\column{0.75\textwidth}
the \Sun\ perfects a \Square\  to \Mars, \\
committing his disposition to \Mars, who  \\
receives the \Sun\ in his domicile (\Aries), and so \\
\textsl{accepts} the \Sun's disposition and will perfect it, but \\
due to the \Square\, \\ 
only after some anxiety and errors i.e. not easily
\end{columns}

\subsubsection{Committing Disposition - Another Example}
\begin{frame}[t]{Committing Disposition - Another Example}
\textbf{Example:}\footnotemark[1]
\begin{columns}[T, onlytextwidth]
\column{0.25\textwidth}
\Sun\ 1 \Libra\ $\Rightarrow$ \Opposition\ \Saturn\ 25 \Aries

\column{0.01\textwidth}
\rule{.1mm}{.20\textheight}

\column{0.75\textwidth}
the \Sun\ applying to \Opposition\ \Saturn\ from the Exaltation of \Saturn\ (\Libra) \\
\Saturn\ is in the Exaltation of the \Sun\ (\Aries), therefore \\
there is \textbf{Mutual Recption} by \textsl{exaltation}, and \\
the \Sun\ commits his disposition to \Saturn, who accepts it
\end{columns}
\vspace{0.25cm}
According to Masha'Allah, when there is Mutual Reception, \textsl{"there is peace and the matter will be perfected"}; however, if \Saturn\ leaves \Aries\ before the \Opposition\ can perfect, \textsl{"there will be enmities, contrariness, misunderstandings, denials and \Saturn\ will not receive the \Sun"} and so will not take on the \Sun's disposition.

And the same if the \Sun\ had been in its own Exaltation (\Aries) and \Saturn\ in his own Exaltation (\Libra) as neither planet would receive the other.

\footnotetext[1]{The examples used by Masha'Allah so far involve planets in their sign of Fall or Detriment which we will see (in later examples), may result in a commitment being rejected.}
