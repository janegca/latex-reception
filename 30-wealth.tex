\subsection{Finding Wealth or Not}
\begin{frame}[t]{Finding Wealth or Not [JH 29-31][RH 23-25]}
If the question is about wealth in general, and not specific to some source or person, examine L1 and the \Moon\ to see which is the main significator of the querent and which the sharer and use L2 as the significator of the quesited, wealth.

\begin{block}{}
\textsl{"The connection of the ruler of the Asc or the \Moon\ with the ruler of the thing is the attainment of the thing by itself"}, whether joined to a benefic or malefic, with or without reception, \underline{unless} the significator of the quesited commits its disposition to another planet.\footnotemark[1]
\end{block}

If L2 commits its disposition to:
\begin{itemize}
\item a malefic, with reception, \textsl{"the thing will be perfected"}
\item a benefic, with or without reception, \textsl{"he will find wealth...if the dispositor is in a strong [place] or in the angles"} as angles are useful to the 2nd and hasten things; cadent houses delay things
\end{itemize}

Wealth is also shown if the 2nd holds: a benefic, a dignified malefic, or a malefic without dignity that receives L1.

\footnotetext[1]{Hand says this is true only for the stronger of the two, L1 or \Moon.}

\begin{frame}[t]{Finding Wealth or Not Continued}
If L1 joins with L2 or planets in the 2nd, the querent has been seeking wealth but if L2 joins with L1, the wealth will come about without any seeking on the querent's part and they will receive more than they hoped for.

\textbf{If no L1, \Moon, 2nd House Connections}

If L1 or the \Moon\ do not connect to L2 or a planet in the 2nd, see if one of them connects to a benefic (with or without reception) that is in a strong place or angular; if that benefic does not commit its disposition elsewhere, the querent will find wealth. 

And the same applies if it connects to a malefic with reception but if it is without reception, the matter will be destroyed.

\begin{block}{}
A benefic that commits its disposition to a malefic who does not receive it signifies the matter ruled by the benefic will be harmed when the disposition is complete; with reception, the matter is perfected without harm.
